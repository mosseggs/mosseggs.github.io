<h2>Define Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>What should this site accomplish?</li>
<li>Whom is it for?</li>
<li>Create&nbsp;<em>measurable</em> goals for your site.</li>
<li>The more specific you are here, the easier it will be to create the content for the site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consider Audience</h2>
<ul>
<li>Who do you want to see this? Can you think of them as specific people? Create personas!</li>
<li>What do they want to see/do? Why would they come here?</li>
<li>How does this relate to other things they see/do?</li>
<li>Is the content/design/interaction designed for your intended audience?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gather Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorm.</li>
<ul>
<li>List numerous ideas without being critical.</li>
<li>An off-the-wall idea may help bring an excellent &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; idea to mind.</li>
</ul>
<li>List features that client wants.</li>
<li>Examine other sites.</li>
<li>Ask potential users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Organize Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take ideas and consider them.</li>
<ul>
<li>Do they help the goals of the site defined at the beginning?</li>
<li>Seek maximum impact on target audience with minimum resource consumption.</li>
</ul>
<li>Sort ideas into categories.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Determine Navigation</h2>
<ul>
<li>How should this be organized?</li>
<ul>
<li>By category?</li>
<li>By date?</li>
<li>By alphabetical order?</li>
<li>Others?</li>
</ul>
<li>Draw a conceptual diagram.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sketch Pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Still on paper, draw some pages.</li>
<li>Sketch a representative page at each level of the site.</li>
<li>A lot of planning should happen on paper before you ever start building things on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Build</h2>
<p>(duh)</p>
<h2>Test</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want a great site, you've got to test...</p>
<p>I finally realized that testing is really more like having friends visiting from out of town. Inevitably, as you make the rounds of the local tourist sites with them, you see things about your hometown that you usually don't notice because you're so used to them. And at the same time, you realize that a lot of things that you take for granted aren't obvious to everybody.</p>
<p>Testing one user is 100 percent better than testing none...</p>
<p>Testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 near the end...</p>
<small>Steve Krug, <em>Don't Make Me Think</em>, pp. 114-115</small></blockquote>
<p>During testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a list of problems identified during testing</li>
<li>Rank that list, with most important problems at the top</li>
<li>Decide how each problem will be addressed and who will do it</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all problems are created equal: you might be able to quickly bang out solutions to many small problems to get them out of the way early</li>
<li>"Resist the impulse to add things,"&nbsp; says Steve Krug. Sometimes it's best to take something away.&nbsp;<br /><br />
<blockquote>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.<br /><small>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</small></blockquote>
Less is (often) more.</li>
<li>Remember that users often don't know what they want. Consider most feature requests only after there's a consensus among testers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Build, Test, Maintain, Archive</h2>
<ul>
<li>Iterate!<br /><br /><img title="The Design Process" src="Design_Process.png" alt="The Design Process" /></li>
