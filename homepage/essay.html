        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The City's Outcast</h2>
          <div>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Ever since I was young, the one main constant in my life has been Hylan Boulevard. It’s the longest road on Staten Island, going top to bottom along the east side. Hylan had tons of family-owned businesses like New China Buffet, run by a family we went to church with, or Number 1, in the Hylan Shopping Center. There were all the car dealerships, more than ten, the independent restaurants, like Red Apple or Zara, the one building under construction, abandoned since before I was born, the chain businesses, enough to supply but not to overwhelm. It was mostly quiet except for the vehicle engines and the occasional ambulance. Not many people were around, as we usually keep to ourselves. It may have been dull and, for some odd reason, very beige, but it's calm and easygoing.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;But the New York we all think of isn't like that. New York is full of chain businesses or shops that have fought to ensure they endured the test of time. New York is loud, with the honking of car horns and the crowds of people stomping to their destination. I might live in New York City, but I don't live in “New York City”; I only live in Staten Island. My relationship with New York is just like someone coming from New Jersey or Long Island. We’re isolated from New York in the eyes of the people. Just as someone from New Jersey doesn't care about the things in New York, I didn't even care about Manhattan and the rest as I went to a school in Manhattan. I was only introduced to “SoHo” in my tenth-grade mandarin class, a concept I was oblivious to until then. After all, it was a foreign place to me.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;SoHo, like Hylan, represents the larger place they’re a part of, each giving an insight into what the area is supposed to be like. In contrast to the small businesses standing out along Hylan in Staten Island, the businesses of SoHo and the rest of “New York” are big chain stores like Uniqlo or Starbucks and the social media viral sensations that I don't know about. It runs on hard work and capitalism, the essentials of the “American dream” that people come to New York to face. Hylan, and Staten Island by association, isn't any of that. SoHo is urban, bustling with people rushing to their next destination. But Hylan is suburban, with the next pedestrian being at least half a block away. Everything about them are opposites, from their size and organization to their contents. Just like SoHo is supposed to be the center of Manhattan and New York, Hylan is the center of Staten Island.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Honestly though, why would you want to be in Staten island? It’s just some place off the coast of Manhattan and Brooklyn. It's an island, just as isolated from the city as the name suggests. The only notoriety it has is the landfills and the ferry. Who would care for Staten Island? Even on MTA maps, it's in its own boxed-off corner. It’s the Hawaii and Alaska of New York. It's farther from Brooklyn than New Jersey. Why would you want to live near Hylan? They have terrible jobs, that's why all the suited men and women of Staten Island leave on the Sim buses to Manhattan. After all, they’re run by small businesses there. No way they would have as good an economy as the land with capitalism’s firm grip around everyone’s neck. Hylan is Quiet, Suburban, dull, and beige; it's not a place a “New Yorker” needs.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Yet, New York isn’t much better. The rent’s expensive, it’s always cramped, and it stinks. The place’s noisy, the crime rates high, and capitalism's rampant. The city’s dirty, the traffic’s held for two hours, and the people are rude. Why would you wanna live there? Staten Island has space, after all, most of the population owns houses. We have one of, if not the, lowest crime rates in the entirety of the real New York City. We have cheaper living costs, and for housing instead of rent too. We have SIT, one of the elite SHSAT schools. Why wouldn’t you want to live here instead?<br>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Despite how others may perceive it, I care for Hylan and Staten Island, even if it isn’t in everyone else’s New York. It’s a place for us and us alone. We’re the only ones who need to know of the Sim buses or the turkeys in the trees. They can have their Katz's Delicatessens and their lettered and numbered trains.  We have our Royal Crowns and the Staten Island Railroad. They can keep their Manhattan bridge and their FDR drives. We have our Verrazano bridge and the Staten Island Expressway. They can keep their apartments and their cramped housing. We have our houses with backyards and private property. They can keep their SoHo and “New York”, because we have our Hylan Boulevard and Staten Island.<br>
